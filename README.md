# PythonTradingBot
There are two scripts, one is a stock trading bot that connects to the Alpaca API,
the other in a crypto trading bot which connects to Bitmex.
Both have the following strategy:
  BUY when the price rises above the moving average.
  SHORT/SELL when the price dips below the moving average.
